  ## Description
  The Kanban Board is a full-stack task management app designed to help agile teams visually organize their workflows. Users can securely log in to manage tasks categorized under To Do, In Progress, and Done columns.

  This application features JWT (JSON Web Token) authentication to safeguard user sessions. By verifying identities and authorizing requests through JWTs, the platform ensures a smooth and secure user experience throughout the task management process.
